Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tyrs allow you some configurations, let's see the way it's works.

It's base on the 'ConfigParser' core module from python, and it's a very
readable and easy to get through syntax. All the configuration is based on this
schema:

[source,conf]
------------
[section1]
param1 = string
param2 = 42
[section2]
other_param = otherValue
...
------------

So far, there are only three sections for the configuration, they will be explain in details
in this chapter. But a quick reminder:

* *colors*: Customisation of colors.
* *keybinding*: Customisation of keys shortcuts.
* *params*: Some other params.

NOTE: All sections and parameters are lower case, for params composed with two
words, they are separate with an underscore `'_'' (no camelCase).

Configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration file is located in '~/.config/tyrs/tyrs.cfg'.
You may handle several configuration file, as for the account, with an
argument when you start Tyrs. The argument will append to the filename of the
configuration.

.Custom config file
[source,bash]
$ tyrs -c foo

This will read the configuration from the '~/.config/tyrs/tyrs.cfg.foo'.

CAUTION: You don't need to pass as argument the full filename, as it will read from
some 'tyrs.cfg.tyrs.cfg.foo' file if you do so.
