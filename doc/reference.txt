Installation
------------

ArchLinux
~~~~~~~~~

As Tyrs is aviable on AUR, the installation is the easiest way. Just use
'Yaourt' or any AUR-helpers, and grab a copy from the user repository

[source,bash]
yaourt -S tyrs

From source
~~~~~~~~~~~

Dependency
^^^^^^^^^^

Tyrs requires some dependencies

* Python 2
* link:http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/[python-twitter]
* link:https://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2[python-oauth2]

The installation depends of the distribution use, with debian or ubuntu it will be
[source,bash]
apt-get install python-twitter python-oauth2

.Issue with Ubuntu 11.04
[IMPORTANT]
================================
An issue was found with Ubuntu 11.04 and the current python-twitter package,
this wasn't fixed yet, but can work fine, if you get the last library aviable,
as follow in a console:
[source,bash]
apt-get remove python-twitter
wget http://python-twitter.googlecode.com/files/python-twitter-0.8.2.tar.gz
tar xvf python-twitter-0.8.2.tar.gz && cd python-twitter-0.8.2
python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

=================================

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is two way to get Tyrs installed:

* With _setup.py_, this allow a clean install, like with the autotools for C
programs (you surely know, `configure', `make', `make install')
* Just lauch the main file like a python script will work fine as well

We will go throught both way, I recommends to use the first solution

First, get the last tarball (curently, the last one is the {revision}) +
http://src.nicosphere.net/tyrs/tyrs-{revision}.tar.gz

[source,bash]
tar xvf tyrs-0.1.3.tar.gz
cd tyrs

.With setup.py

python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

Those commands decompress the tarball, go to the repertory, prepare the
installation (you can checks files that will be install here), and then install
it, note that _the last command need to be done as_ *root*. And that's all, just
run Tyrs with a simple :

[source,bash]
tyrs

.Without setup.py

Well, you just need to lauch it, the main entry of the script is 'tyrs/tyrs.py'
so you need to call it with python like this:

[source,bash]
python tyrs/tyrs.py

Github
~~~~~~

The development of Tyrs is based at link:https://github.com/Nic0/tyrs[Github],
you can easely get the lastest development version.

[source,bash]
git clone git://github.com/Nic0/tyrs.git

You may follow the same installation steps seen above to get this version work.

.Arch Linux
[TIP]
=================================
A package is aviable from AUR to retrieve the last verion from github.
[source,bash]
yaourt -S tyrs-git

=================================

[[configuration]]
Configuration
-------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tyrs allow you some configurations, let's see the way it's works.

It's base on the 'ConfigParser' core module from python, and it's a very
readable and easy to get through syntax. All the configuration is based on this
schema:

[source,conf]
------------
[section1]
param1 = string
param2 = 42
[section2]
other_param = otherValue
...
------------

So far, there are only three sections for the configuration, they will be explain in details
in this chapter. But a quick reminder:

* *colors*: Customisation of colors.
* *keybinding*: Customisation of keys shortcuts.
* *params*: Some other params.

NOTE: All sections and parameters are lower case, for params composed with two
words, they are separate with an underscore `'_'' (no camelCase).

Configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration file is located in '~/.config/tyrs/tyrs.cfg'.
You may handle several configuration file, as for the account, with an
argument when you start Tyrs. The argument will append to the filename of the
configuration.

.Custom config file
[source,bash]
$ tyrs -c foo

This will read the configuration from the '~/.config/tyrs/tyrs.cfg.foo'.

CAUTION: You don't need to pass as argument the full filename, as it will read from
some 'tyrs.cfg.tyrs.cfg.foo' file if you do so.

Colors
