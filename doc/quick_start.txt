Tyrs Quick Start
=================
:author: Nicolas Paris


This is a short introduction to using Tyrs, and doesn't go into
too much detail about configuration or installation. It is intended
to get you up and running Tyrs quickly.

For more information, you could read these documents:

* link:reference.html[Full documentation.]
* link:reference.html#installation[The installation guide.]

First authentification
----------------------

You may be aware, Twitter uses a specific authentification called OAuth, and the
first step is to authenticate with Twitter. It's very easy.

First, in a web browser, you will be prompted to allow Tyrs to *access your
Twitter account*. +
When you start the application, and it doesn't find a profile file, it will
print:

.Message when no profile is detected
--------------------
There is no profile detected.

It should be in /home/nicolas/.config/tyrs/tyrs.cfg
If you want to setup a new account, let's go through some basic steps
If you want to skip this, just press return or ctrl-C.

Requesting temp token from Twitter

Please visit this Twitter page and retrieve the pincode to be used
in the next step to obtaining an Authentication Token:

https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=OxFDW4zW3YeiueuizjazAa4VSdeuieuiMO5b8GpS8EoDKRM

Pincode?
-------------------

You only need to go to the link show above, and copy the code that the
Twitter provides. And that's it, you are now able to access Twitter from your console.

[TIP]
===================
If you have several accounts, you can specify which one to use by starting the application with
`-a` argument.
[source,bash]
tyrs -a foo

Configuration
-------------

You can add a configuration file, there is no need to have one for Tyrs to work, 
but you can customize your keybindings, color and basic behavior.

The configuration file should be placed in '~/.config/tyrs/tyrs.cfg'

To learn how the configuration works, check the
link:reference.html#configuration[configuration part] of the reference guide.


[TIP]
You may have more than one configuration file. To use an account-specific .cfg
file, start with a `-c` argument. (or `--config`)
